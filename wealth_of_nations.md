> OF THE CAUSES OF IMPROVEMENT IN THE PRODUCTIVE POWERS OF LABOUR, AND OF THE ORDER ACCORDING TO WHICH ITS PRODUCE IS NATURALLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE DIFFERENT RANKS OF THE PEOPLE

## Of division of labour

* Specialization of tasks leads to higher efficiency
* Manufacture allows greater division of labour than agriculture, therefore benefits more from the labour division
* Speculation is also labour, because it leads to new inventions. However, reward is proportional to capital invested, not labour done.

## Of the principle which gives occasion to division of labour
* Division of labour is thanks to deliberate barter in pursuing self interest
* People are differentiated because of different employments. If everyone were doing the same job, all people would be more similar to each other

## That the division of labour is limited by extent of the market
* Division of labour is limited by the size of market
* Water carriage allows much higher division of labour than inland trading
* Without water carriage, globalization would be impossible
* Early navigation - rivers, seas (Egypt, Mediterranean)
* Later navigation - open seas (England, Spanish, Portuguese)

## Of the original and use of money
* Metals - divisible, durable, coined in mint
* Value as utility of particular object (Value in Use) e.g. water
* Value as mean of purchasing power (Value in exchange) e.g. diamond
* Labour is the only real measure of all exchangeable value

## Of the real and nominal price of commodities, or of their price of labour, and their price in money
* Labour is the only real measure of price of everything
* Labour is an abstract measure - therefore people started using different measures, such as gold
* Price of gold is not accurate measure because it depends on fertility of mines and other factors.

## Of the component part of the price of commodities
* In the world without capital, price of every commodity would be determined only by labour
* Without capital, value of every commodity fully resolves to worker’s wage only
* With capital, it resolves to a wage + profit for capital provider
* Therefore, in capitalism, the whole produce of labour doesn’t fully belong to labourer
* If land is private, price partly resolves also to rent on land
* More advanced industry, more of the price resolves to capital and less to a rent + labour
* Three original sources of revenue and exchangeable value are rent, capital and labour

## Of the natural and market price of commodities
* Average rate of wages and profit is driven by society and nature of each employment
* Average rate of rent is driven by general society circumstances and fertility of land
* Natural price of commodity is price which implies average return on capital, rent and labour cost
* Market price is driven by supply and demand
* Fluctuations in market price around natural price are because of fluctuations in profits and wages. Rent fluctuates much less.
* Secrets in manufacture leads to extraordinary profits
* Secrets in manufacture are kept longer than secrets in trade

## Of the wages and labour
* If apple production improves 10x and oranges production only 2x, both are cheaper in labour terms. However, for orange producer, apples appear to be 5x dearer.
* Masters have much higher bargaining power than workers
* Masters start bidding against each other only when hands are scarce
* Demand for labour can’t increase faster than funds destined to pay wages
* Wages bottom-up from minimum only when capital growth overtakes population growth
* Otherwise, wages always stay at minimum no matter how rich or developed the country is (e.g. China was stagnating for centuries)

## Of wages and profits in different employments of labour and stock
* Wages in different employments are different, based on effort and probably of success.
* People overvalue changes of gain and undervalue changes of loss - this is good for insurance and lottery business.
* People enlist to army because they underestimate the risks
* Ordinary rate of profit rises with business risk, but not fast enough to compensate it completely.
* Return driven by presumption of success.

# BOOK II
> OF THE NATURE, ACCUMULATION, AND EMPLOYMENT OF STOCK

## Introduction
* No division of labour = no need to accumulate stock
* Division of labour = worker needs to be maintained by accumulated stock (money) until his own produce is finished and sold
* Accumulation of stock must be previous to the division of labour
* Stock accumulation induces division of labour automatically, because capitalists is looking to maximize return on capital, therefore employs the best processes and machines.

## Of the division of stock
* Labouring poor derives revenue only from Labour (no capital stock beyond few days)
* Capital can be employed in two different ways to raise revenue
  * Trading the circulating capital
  * Purchasing and using the fixed capital
* Stock of any country consists of
  * Stock for immediate consumption
  * Fixed capital (machines, buildings, infrastructure, education)
  * Circulating capital (afford revenue only by changing masters)
* Every fixed capital is maintained by and originally derived from circulating capital
* Only way how fixed capital can yield revenue is via circulating capital
* Circulating capital is constantly drained to support Society via consumption and Fixed capital
* Circulating capital is re-supplied from Land, Mines and Fisheries
* Under tolerable security, everyone aims to employ capital in three different ways: Consumption, Fixed capital and Circulating capital

## Of money, considered as a particular branch of the general stock of society, or of the expense of maintaining the national capital
* Price of every commodity resolves to rent + profit  + labour
* It is net, not the gross revenue which is proportional to the wealth of nation
* Expenditures for fixed capital are entirely excluded from society’s net revenue
* What doesn’t go to maintenance of fixed capital can go to circulating capital which increase jobs and output
* Maintenance of circulating capital (except money) withdraw noting from annual revenue of society
* Fixed capital is diminishing net revenue because it is drawing circulating capital from for its own maintenance
* Money require certain expense as well (collection, support, minting, mining, storage, security)
* Money is just wheels of circulation, altogether different to goods which they are circulating. As such, they are not part of the net revenue of society.

## Of the accumulation of capital or of productive and unproductive labour
* Productive labour is the one which adds to the value of goods which its works upon. It produces something which could then purchase equal amount of labour.
* The whole annual produce is result of productive labour only
* Unproductive labour perishes at very instant of their own performance
* Annual produce which goes into capital investments is always maintaining productive hands
* Annual produce going to profit/rent may also maintain unproductive hands
* Spending (revenue) and savings (investments) ultimately resolve to the same consumption (food, lodging and clothing). Consumption is the same but consumers are different (revenue maintains unproductive hands, capital maintains productive hands)
* Feudalism: almost everything which lands produces goes into consumption, very little to investments
* Capitalism: big part of what land produces goes into re-investments
* In opulent countries, revenue from capital is much higher than revenue from the rent.
* In opulent countries, yield on capital is much lower in percentage terms.
* Cities maintained by capital: English, Dutch, Roumen, Bordeaux
* Cities maintained by revenue: Paris, Versailles, Vienna, Madrid, Rome
* In city where great revenue is spent, it is very difficult to employ capital for any other purpose than supplying the consumption
* Proportion between capital and revenue = proportion between industry and idleness
* It is important what amount of work is done within the country, not the amount of gold imported.
* Gold outflow is just consequence of idleness. But the real problem is diminishing amount of goods which is circulated by this gold.

# BOOK III
> OF THE DIFFERENT PROGRESS OF OPULENCE IN DIFFERENT NATIONS

## Of the natural progress of opulence
* Commerce between town and country is mutually beneficial
* Country supplies raw materials and subsidence, town supplies manufactured produce
* Countries neighbouring to town enjoy higher profit son produce than more distant countries
* Industry which produces subsidence must be prior industry which produces convenience and luxury. There are no great towns without neighbouring countryside.
* Only surplus of country constitutes subsidence of town
* Upon equal profits, every man invests in agriculture first, second to manufacture and then to foreign trade. Improved land secures capital much better than capital abroad.
* In every political system, wealth of towns is always proportional to cultivation of country.
* When there is plenty of land to cultivate (like America), no manufacture is exported to distant countries, because domestic farmers are very competitive in offering subsidence for towns.
* Only when all capital requirements of farming and manufacture have been satisfied, capital can be committed to foreign commerce.
* Advantage if rude produce can be exported by foreign capital, so domestic capital of society can be employed more usefully. American and Indian colonies greatly benefited from this.
* In modern states of Europe, due to government interventions, nature of things has been sometimes inverter. Principal improvements in agriculture followed as last.

## Of the discouragement of agriculture in the ancient state of Europe, after the fall of the Roman Empire
* German and Scythian nations overran provinces of Roman Empire, disrupted natural state of things, towns remained deserted and land uncultivated.
* Their leaders acquired all the land. All land had proprietor but nothing has been cultivated – beginning of feudalism.
*  Law of primogeniture prevented division of land.
* Land as source of subsidence is naturally subdivided. Natural law of succession in Roman Empire.
* Land as source of protection is better not to be subdivided. E.g. law of primogeniture in Feudalism
*  Law of primogeniture dictates that every successful generation has no equal rights on earth.
* Great proprietor is seldom a great improver, busy defending his own territories.
* Great proprietor focuses first on his own elegance and then 500 acres around his house. Had he spend money on all his land in such a wasteful way, he would be soon bankrupt.
* Improvements can neither be expected from proprietor’s bondmen.
* Bondmen could acquire nothing but their daily maintenance.
* Bondmen’s work is the most expensive from all. They eat as much and work as little as possible.
* Metayers in France were provided with capital, 50% of crop belonged to them. Therefore they had interest in squeezing from land as much as possible, however they were not motivated to commit their own capital
* English Tenants were paying rent to landlord. They were also motivated in laying their own capital.
* Farmer which pays rent is able to improve land more slowly than land cultivate by proprietor. This is because rent is directed partly towards unproductive hands.

## Of the rise and progress of cities and towns, after the fall of Roman Empire
* Ancient Greek cities occupied by owner-occupiers, surrounded by walls
* Feudal settlements – castle in the middle, all dependants living outside, tradesmen, merchants with no freedom. All of their possessions belonged to lord upon their death.
* 1st step to freedom: individual city men allowed paying single pool tax to lord for protection instead of collection of taxes.
* 2nd step to freedom: whole boroughs became free – freedom to collect their own taxes and pay lump-sum tax to lord.
* Principal attributes of slaves removed from burghers
* Free boroughs were given freedom from king. Naturally, lords didn’t like this. Boroughs had to join mutual alliances to defend their selves against lords.
* Burghers hated lords. King hated and feared lords as well. But king had no reason to hate burghers. Mutual support against lords.
* King who lived on bad terms with lords was more liberal against burghs.
* In some cases, cities built so powerful militia, they became independent republics, in distant parts of the country
* Order and good government in cities, while countryside exposed to every sort of violence. Countrymen escaping from lords to cities.
* If free town was on river, it gave taste of foreign products to the whole country – for a large quantity of rude produce.
* Richer countries have clothes and household furniture of the lowest rank of people coming of the foreign production.
* Later, free towns instead of importing finished foreign goods; they imported only foreign materials and manufactured products on their own.

## How the commerce of towns contributed to the improvement of the country
* Increases of towns’ riches contributed to improvement of a country
  * Buying products of country by towns encourages country to be more productive
  * Providing capital to country. Money employed chiefly in profitable projects. Local countrymen had no capital, just savings from their own annual revenue.
  * Commerce introduced good government to country, liberty and security to individual. No wars with neighbours.
* Without foreign produce and fine manufacture, country lord had nothing to buy. His dependants have nothing to offer him in return for his hospitality. He often maintained 1000 men in manor.
* King was obliged to abandon administration of justice to local lords. Similarly, command of country militia leaved at local lords.
* Only reason why lords paid respect to king was protection against outside threats.
* When land proprietor spends his revenue on maintaining tenants, they are very dependent upon them and he can easily command them.
* When he buys fine products, he is indirectly maintaining the same amount of people, but has very little direct control compared to the previous scenario. Tradesmen have no single lord.
* Landlords dismissed unnecessary numbers of their tenants.
* In commercial countries, old families passing fortune over generations are very rare – people are able to easily spend money.
* Arab countries with little commerce are full of genealogies.
* In Europe, purchase of land was very unprofitable. Primogeniture kept most of the land out of market – inflated prices and decreased return on investment.
* Purchasing cheap land in America yielded in much higher RoI.
* Without primogeniture, inherited land is fractioned and sold.

# BOOK IV
> OF SYSTEMS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY

## Of the principle of the commercial and mercantile system
* Principle of commercial and mercantile system which employs restrains and encouragements to increase amount of country gold by turning balance of trade in its favour
* Political economy
  * How people can provide plentiful revenue and subsidence for themselves
  * How to raise enough tax revenues to be sufficient to provide public services.
* Two political systems of political economy:
  * Commerce
  * Agriculture
* Spaniards were asking for gold when conquering country. Tartars were asking about sheep. Tartars were closer to the true value.
* If nation can be separated from world, it doesn’t matter how much gold it circulates
* Countries often prohibited gold exportation
  * Very difficult to prohibit by rules. Easier to focus on Balance of Trade
  * If country has advantage, exporting gold may in fact yield to more gold imports later as domestic goods are sold.
  * High price of exchange (gold) due to prohibition increased unfavourable balance of trade.
* It is not gold discoveries in America which enriched Europe – but opening new markets. Gold in fact lost 2/3 of its purchasing power.
* Trading with East Indies was never so advantageous than trading with India – monopolized by East India Company.
* Discovery of America opened new market and gave occasion to new division of labour
* Commercial system proposes to increase quantity of gold by
  * Banning import of specific goods
  * Banning import from specific countries
  * Encouraging exportation by drawbacks, bounties and advantageous treaties of commerce.
  * Colonies in distant countries.

## Of restraints upon importation from foreign countries of such goods as can be produced at home
* Regulation causes that greater share of capital and resources goes to domestic monopoly than otherwise would go
* No regulation of commerce can increase quantity of industry beyond what is the society’s capital
* Every individual naturally employs his capital as close to his home as possible – indirectly benefiting the whole society as well
* No one makes home what is cheaper to buy elsewhere
* Industry can augment only as fast as the capital stock. Capital can augment only as fast as revenue. Regulation diminishes revenue
* Hence, capital grows fastest on its own
* Revenge prohibition of imports doesn’t benefit the class of people which were originally hurt – it benefits some other class.
* Restrictions should be abolished slowly to let people to find alternative employment.
* Easier to change direction of industry from one to other than to create something new out of nothing. Circulating financial capital finds employment more easily than fixed capital.

## Of the extraordinary restrains upon the importation of goods of almost all kinds, from those countries with which the balance is supposed to be disadvantageous
* Incorrect doctrine that country with positive balance of trade gains on expense of counterpart with negative balance.
* Advantage means not increase of the amount of gold, but increase of exchangeable value of annual produce of the land and labour in country, or increase of annual revenue of its inhabitants.
* It is advantageous to have rich neighbours. Rich country is likely to be a better customer.
* Manufacture of rich nation can be dangerous rival to domestic producer; however it is advantageous to the greatest body of people.
* More important than balance of trade is the balance of annual produce and consumption.
* Positive balance of annual produce and consumption is paramount because revenue which is not consumed yet goes to capital accumulation.
* Balance of annual production and consumption may be constantly in favour while balance of trade may be negative. Such nation may import more than export, gradually decaying all gold. However the real wealth – exchangeable value of annual produce goes up.
* North American colonies had long time before 1776 positive balance of produce and consumption, but negative balance of trade with Great Britain – yet they have greatly benefited anyway.

## Of Colonies
* Great Britain disallowed colonies to 
  * Export their surplus to international markets
  * Import from elsewhere than mother country
  * Paying fees when importing to mother countries, except for resale
* Merchants lobbied re-exportation drawbacks when exporting from colonies via mother country. As a side effect, re-exportation drawbacks benefited colonies as well.
* Re-exportation drawbacks caused round-about trade via mother country. Mother country suffered, because too much circulating capital was locked-in round-about trade.
* Colony trade is benefiting mother country. Monopoly of that trade not.
* Monopoly of colony trade raising RoI for monopolist only.
* Monopoly via increased RoI discourages land improvement in mother country. Rent on land in mother country is retarded.
* Exorbitant profits of Lisbon merchants haven’t augmented capital of Portugal.
* Maintaining monopoly with US colonies benefited only few, but expense of naval force was paid by everyone.
* Colonies of Spain and Portugal give more real encouragement to industry of other countries than that of Spain and Portugal.
* Profits of Hamburg merchant were impaired when trading with US via London merchants, but he certainly received returns on his capital much more quickly.
* Capital of Hamburg merchants therefore can keep in employment much greater quantity of German industry.
* London merchant’s employment is more profitable than other employments in London, but less advantageous to his country on account of slower returns.
* Private interests of men naturally lead them to divide stock of every country among all employment which is most agreeable to the interest of the whole society.
* Different regulations derange this natural distribution
* Monopoly of UK colony trade with US diverted UK capital
  * From neighbouring to more distant countries
  * From direct consumption to transit (carry) trade
* UK maintained fleet of vessels to enforce monopoly. Hence it derived nothing but net loss from the monopoly trade.

## Of the agricultural systems, or of those systems of political economy which represent the produce of land, as either the sole or the principal source of revenue and wealth of every country
* Mercantile-oriented systems like monopoly trading with US colonies in UK, although retarding the overall revenue of the country, they at least are promoting what they intend to promote
* Reason for promotion of mercantile-oriented systems is lobbying from merchants.
* Agricultural systems are discouraging commerce for religious and other reasons. As a side effect, they are also discouraging the agriculture which they intend to promote.
* Agriculture can only flourish if it has motivation to export its surplus produce to towns in exchange for refined products
* China
  * Chinese favour agriculture more. Conditions of agricultural workers are superior to the artificers
  * China is self-sufficient market itself which would afford greater division of labour through navigable rivers.
  * Because of self-sufficiency, they have very little opportunity to learn from other nations.
* Egypt
  * Superstitious aversion to the sea. Hence not too much opportunities to export produce or to make more fine products.
* Greece
  * Foreign trade prohibited. Manufacture considered fit only for slaves, which are seldom inventive.

# BOOK V
> OF THE REVENUE OF SOVEREIGN OR COMMONWEATH

## Of the expense of sovereign or commonwealth
* Of the expense of defence
  * Professional Army > Militia of barbarian nations > Militia of civilized society
  * More developed nation = harder to train militia without opportunity cost
  * Barbarian nations are get used to commute and therefore more to obey their leaders (better warriors)
  * For husbandman, nature “does the work” between seedtime and harvest, hence plenty of time to train for martial arts. This is not the case for carpenter, who has to be maintained by others.
  * Proportion of people who can go to war is much lower in civilized society
  * Natural habits of people in more civilized society render them completely incapable to defend their selves.
  * Since invention of firearms, strength and agility of body less important than regularity, order and prompt obedience.
  * Noise of firearms makes more difficult to preserve order
* Of the expense of justice
  * When men have no property, no motivation to injure each other in person or in reputation
  * Whenever great property, there great inequality
  * When there is no property, civil government is not necessary. 
  * In order to make every individual feel secure, it is necessary judicial power to be separated from executive power
* Of the expense of public works and institutions
  * Public works which are advantageous to a great body of people but due to their nature profit would never repay for expense of any individual.
  * Public works facilitating commerce of society (bridges, canals, harbours)
  * Whenever possible, maintain facility by toll first, local revenue secondly, and then by global revenue
  * Public works for education  
  * Due to division of labour, people would become ignorant; hence it is obligation of government to provide education.

## Of the sources of the general or public revenue of the society
* Revenue which sovereign needs must be drawn from two sources
  * Funds which belong to sovereign
  * From revenue of people via taxation
* It makes more sense to privatize crown land between people and to raise revenue via taxation instead
* Maxims regarding collation of taxes
  * Contributions in proportions to abilities
  * Tax should be certain, not arbitrary
  * Timing of tax should be most convenient for contributor
  * Prevent inefficiency of collection due to great number of officers
  * Avoid taxes distorting capital allocation
  * Avoid bullying businesses, because that is also (non-monetary) cost.

## Of public debts
* In rude state of society
  * person enjoying great revenue has no other way to spend it than maintaining as many people as he can
  * Since trade was disgraceful and lending was considered usury, lords had no other option than to hoard money
  * In case of war, money were hoarded because they are easier to conceal and to fund army
  * In peacetime, when standing army is not necessary, sovereign had only limited ways how to spend money, so he hoarded as well.
* In commercial country
  * Great proprietors spends great part of revenue in purchasing luxuries
  * Therefore lord dismiss their retainers, make tenants independent and gradually becomes insignificant as the greater part of the wealthy burghers.
  * Amassing of treasury is no longer expected
  * When extraordinary circumstances require expenditures, no other option than to borrow. Raising taxes reactively would take too long, perhaps one year.
* Country abounding with merchants abounds with set of people who always have in their power to advance large sums of money to government.
* Commerce can seldom flourish long if there is no confidence in justice. Borrowing by government cannot be done with this confidence neither
* Lending to the government doesn’t for a moment diminish ability to carry a trade. Commonly it even augments it. Security which is granted to the original creditor is transferable to any other creditor.
* Government foresees the facility of borrowing therefore dispenses itself from the duty of saving.
